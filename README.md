 The objective of this study is to learn more about the Gepang Gath lake expansion and climate over a period of previous 50 years (since 1972).Temperature, humidity, precipitation, and wind speed are the factors that affect climate change, due to variations in these factors climate is changing continuously.The project is done by using satellite images of high and medium resolution raster images that we have from USGS .And also the shapefiles of the lake are creted from USGS and QGIS. Climate parameters are done from NASA Power data.# Climate-change-and-Gepang-Gath-lake-expansion
